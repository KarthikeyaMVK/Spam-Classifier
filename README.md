# ModelTrainer

## 📘 Overview

**ModelTrainer** is a Jupyter Notebook-based project designed for training machine learning models using popular frameworks such as `scikit-learn`, `transformers`, and `xgboost`. This repository includes all necessary scripts and dependencies to reproduce and experiment with various ML pipelines.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
.
├── ModelTrainer.ipynb     # Main notebook for training and evaluating models
├── requirements.txt       # List of dependencies
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

## ⚙️ Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results
- Integration with `transformers` for NLP tasks
- Support for imbalanced datasets using `imbalanced-learn`

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ModelTrainer.git
cd ModelTrainer
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # On Unix or MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Notebook

Launch Jupyter and open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook ModelTrainer.ipynb
```

## 🧪 Dependencies

All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Major packages include:

- `scikit-learn`
- `transformers`
- `xgboost`
- `imbalanced-learn`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data handling

## 📈 Model Evaluation

The notebook includes:
- Accuracy and F1-score metrics
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Cross-validation support

## 📌 Notes

- Make sure your environment supports Jupyter Notebooks.
- If GPU support is needed (e.g., for transformer-based models), ensure CUDA is properly set up.
